            <P>In HTML, start tags and end tags on different lines are always left-aligned with one another. For example, when I see the tag, I can scan vertically down to see its closing tag. It's clear that and are nested within. The same goes for the and tag alignment.

                When an element is nested inside another element, it needs to be indented two spaces from the opening tag. You can see in the above example that is indented two spaces from, and is indented two spaces from.
                
                With a text editor like Atom, you can use the tab key to indent quickly. If you use the tab option, make sure tabs are set to two spaces. Some defaults are set to other amounts, such as four spaces, which is too much white space for HTML and is not standard practice.
                
                To check your settings in Atom, go to the menu bar and select Atom > Preferences, then choose the Editor menu in the sidebar and scroll down to Tab Length.</P>
