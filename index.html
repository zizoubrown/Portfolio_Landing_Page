            <h2>Abdul Aziz</h2>
            <P>Hello everyone, my name is Abdul Aziz Ali. I was born and raised in <strong>Narok town.</strong> That is 3hr travel from Nairobi. I lived with both my parents, and am the <em>first born</em> of 4 siblings. Went to school in a school called Harmony primary school then graduated high school in Narok Boys high school. After high school, my father got sick and he was no-longer able to support us no more. So I had to look for a job so as to help my mother who was the only breadwinner of the family.
               I worked as a cashier at a local supermarket for a year and a half.</P>
            <p>Am now a student at moringa school learning software development. The reason why I took this class is because coding is something so unique and cool. Also it's because I want to change my life and the lives of my family. Come up with ideas that can also help the nation at large. I will do this by solving problems like lack of employment for the youth, security threats on people's data like in banks, debugging, changing the technology in the nation and the mindset of people towards it</p>
            <p>These are example of things I do in my free time:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Both playing a watching soccer.</li>
                    <li>Playing playstation games with my friends.</li>
                    <li>Socializing with people and making new friends.</li>
                    <li>Watching movies/series.</li>
                </ol>
